# A Data Driven Approach to Fund Allocation for HELP International NGO

**Objective**

The primary goal of this project was to strategically allocate the funds raised by HELP International NGO to countries in dire need. By employing clustering models, we aimed to categorize countries based on socio-economic factors, thereby identifying those that require more financial assistance.
